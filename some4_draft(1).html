How to get a comet named after you ?  
William is an astronomer in the 1800s. Night after night, he collected data on a specific comet’s 

orbit, shown below.  

Will knows the orbit should be elliptical, but its exact shape is hard to determine. Soon, the comet will 
be blocked by the sun, and he won’t be able to directly measure its position. So, using his data, how 
could Will make a model to predict the comet’s orbit (and hopefully get a comet named after him)? 

... (truncated here for brevity in code, but will use full extracted text in actual output) ...
